# Analysis of Retail Trade in Belgium
Welcome to this market analytics dashboard!

This app features a data analysis dashboard to investigate retail trade activity in Belgium. The underlying dataset contains a time series of a raw retail index (**Gross Index**) broken down by industries (**NACE Groups**, an european classification of economic activies), starting from January 2006 onwards. Besides the Gross Index, there are other adjusted series (*see below*). 

The source is the Belgian statistical office **Statbel**, which exposes a [lightweight API](https://statbel.fgov.be/en/statistics/bestat/faq) to query belgian statistical data. **Statbel** also hosts a tool to produce crosstables out of their datasets. [Click here](https://bestat.statbel.fgov.be/bestat/crosstable.xhtml?datasource=5d3c2e37-d883-41fe-8c2f-fe8768353aa6) to interact with the same data as the one in this dashboard.
