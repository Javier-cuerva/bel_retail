The dataset consists of a monthly series of the following measurements:

- **Gross index:** Base Index.
- **Trend of the index:** Underlying trend of gross index
- **Index (WDA):** Gross index working days adjusted
- **Index (SA-WDA):** Gross index seasonally and working days adjusted
- **Deflated gross index: Gross index:** Gross index adjusted for inflation
- **Trend of the deflated index:** Underlying trend of deflated index
- **Deflated index (WDA):** Deflated index working days adjusted
- **Deflated index (SA-WDA):** Deflated index seasonally and working days adjusted

The gross index is normalized in such a way that its aggregated value in 2015 is equal to *100* in each **NACE Group**. This means that indices cannot be added accross these groups, since a different multiplier is applied to each of them. There is a total of 17 groups.
